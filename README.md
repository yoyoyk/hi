#[sample] Lights Out !

- Make a scene of simple room/wall having a light bulb and a switch.
- Make the switch control the light bulb. On one click it switches it on and on the other switches it off.
- Brownie points for multiple switches and lights.
- For instance: [This](http://bit.ly/1NQj27P) has a simple toggle switch that makes the bulb turn on and off.
- `HINT:` Make use of JavaScript.
